# JVM internal threads

In addition to User threads created by a java program, when the JVM starts, it creates several internal threads 
each is responsible for handling certain activities of JVM. 

Looking a most simple output of jstack

The "main" is only user thread that executes main method of java class Foo. All others threads are Hotspot internal
threads.

* "Attach Listener" is internal thread that listens on UNIX socket, receives and executes command sent by 
utilities like jstack, jmap, jhat. This thread is kicked off the first time when signal QUIT is received
* "VM Thread" is reponsible to execute VM operations e.g. PrintThreads, ThreadStop, GenCollectFull. 
* "C2 CompilerThread0" and "C2 CompilerThread1" are responsible for compile bytecode to machine code.
* "Signal Dispatcher" is responsible for handling signals sent to the JVM
* "Finalizer" is responsible for executing object's finalizer method
* "Reference Handler" is responsible for clearing soft, weak, phantom references according policy and state of memory
* "Low Memory Detector" detect if the JVM has low memory
* "VM Periodic Task Thread" executes periodic activities that are submitted by java.util.Timer,java.util.TimerTask
